=====

DeSelection is a Sublime Text plugin that allows you to remove a piece of selection by [super] clicking on it.

This is especially useful for removing unwanted selections made by during multiple selection.

check this directory out (or a symlink to it) into `~/Library/Application\ Support/Sublime\ Text\ 3/Packages/` and ST should pick it up automatically.
